          <h2>
            About Mansa Musa, Known to be the richest man in History
          </h2>

          <p id="bio">
            <strong>Biography:</strong><br />
            Mansa Musa (Arabic: منسا موسى, romanized: Mansā Mūsā; r. c. 1312 – c. 1337)
            was the ninth mansa of the Mali Empire, which reached its territorial peak 
            during his reign. Musa is known for his wealth and gift-giving, and has 
            sometimes been called one of the wealthiest people in history.
            <br /><br />
            At the time of Musa's ascension to the throne, Mali in large part consisted 
            of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which Mali had conquered. 
            The Mali Empire consisted of land that is now part of Guinea, Senegal, 
            Mauritania, The Gambia and the modern state of Mali.
            <br /><br />
            Musa went on hajj to Mecca in 1324, traveling with an enormous entourage 
            and a vast supply of gold. En route, he spent time in Cairo, where his 
            lavish gift-giving is said to have noticeably affected the value of gold 
            in Egypt and garnered the attention of the wider Muslim world.
            <br /><br />
            Musa expanded the borders of the Mali Empire, in particular incorporating 
            the cities of Gao and Timbuktu into its territory. He sought closer ties 
            with the rest of the Muslim world, particularly the Mamluk Sultanate and 
            Marinid Sultanate. He recruited scholars from the wider Muslim world to 
            travel to Mali, such as the Andalusian poet Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, and 
            helped establish Timbuktu as a center of Islamic learning. His reign 
            is associated with numerous construction projects, including part of 
            Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu. Musa's reign is often regarded as 
            the zenith of Mali's power and prestige.

          <strong>Name and titles:</strong><br />
            Mansa Musa's personal name was Musa (Arabic: موسى, romanized: Mūsā), 
            the Arabic form of Moses. Mansa, 'ruler'or 'king' in Mandé, 
            was the title of the ruler of the Mali Empire. 
            It has also been translated as "conqueror" and "priest-king". 
            In oral tradition and the Timbuktu Chronicles, Musa is known as Kanku 
            Musa. In Mandé tradition, it was common for one's name to be 
            prefixed by their mother's name, so the name Kanku Musa means "Musa, 
            son of Kanku", although it is unclear if the genealogy implied is 
            literal. He is also called Hidji Mansa Musa in oral tradition 
            in reference to his hajj.
            <br /><br />
            Al-Yafii gave Musa's name as Musa ibn Abi Bakr ibn Abi al-Aswad 
            (Arabic: موسى بن أبي بكر بن أبي الأسود, romanized: 
            Mūsā ibn Abī Bakr ibn Abī al-Aswad), and Ibn Hajar 
            gave Musa's name as Musa ibn Abi Bakr Salim al-Takruri
            <br /><br />
            In the Songhai language, rulers of Mali such as Musa were 
            known as the Mali-koi, koi being a title that conveyed 
            authority over a region: in other words, the "ruler of Mali"
            <br /><br />
        
            <strong>Wealth:</strong><br />
            "Mansa Musa is renowned for his wealth and generosity. 
            Online articles in the 21st century have claimed that Mansa 
            Musa was the richest person of all time"
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Character:</strong><br />
            "Arabic writers, such as Ibn Battuta and Abdallah ibn Asad al-Yafii, 
            praised Musa's generosity, virtue, and intelligence. Ibn Khaldun 
            said that he "was an upright man and a great king, and tales 
            of his justice are still told.""
